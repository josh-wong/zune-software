# Overview

This tutorial describes how to connect a Microsoft Zune device to the Zune software. 

I created this tutorial because syncing your Zune with the Zune software is a bit confusing since Microsoft has removed the software from its site and decommissioned the server for Zune. A few different resources exist that provide the setup files, but no exact instructions on how to:

- Install the Zune software.
- Sync your Zune device with the Zune software.
- Optional: Install apps and games onto your Zune HD.
