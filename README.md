# How to connect a Zune device to the Zune software
This tutorial describes how to connect a Zune device to the Zune software. I created this tutorial because there are a few different resources online that provide these files but no exact instructions on how to:
- Install the Zune software
- Ensure your Zune device syncs with the software.
- Optional: Install the apps and games onto your Zune HD. 

I confirmed that the following instructions work on a Zune HD, and I assume it works the same on other Zune devices. However, the apps and games can be installed on only a Zune HD.

If you encounter any problems with these instructions or if the links no longer work, please feel free to open an issue with details or raise a pull request with your changes.

## Prerequisites
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
	- We will need to make admin changes to the "hosts" file in Windows. To do this, we will use Notepad++ since the default text editor in Windows may not allow you to make administrator-level changes.

## How to install the Zune software
1. Go to [Zune Update - RESOURCES](https://www.zuneupdate.com/resources/).[^1]
2. Click **ZUNE-SOFTWARE.ZIP**, and specify a folder to save the file to.
3. Go to the folder where you downloaded the software package to.
4. Right-click **ZUNE-SOFTWARE.ZIP**, and select **Extract All**. In the wizard, click **Extract**. An executable file will be extracted.
5. Double-click **ZunePackage.exe**.

   > **Note:** User Account Control in Windows may prompt you with the message "**Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device?**" If so, click **Yes**.

5. Click **Accept** if you accept the the terms of the Microsoft license terms.
6. In the window "Zune is ready to install", uncheck **Send info about setup to help improve experience**. You can also choose to install the software in a different location.
7. Click **Install**.

   > **Note:** During installation, Windows may prompt to install .NET Framework 3.5. If so, click **Download and install this feature**. After installation .NET Framework 3.5 is complete, click **Close**. The Zune software will continue installing.

9. After the Zune software installation is complete, click **Close**.

## How to connect the Zune with the Zune software
After installing the Zune software, we need to add a registry setting in Windows and update the "hosts" file in Windows. This will ensure that your Zune can communicate with the Zune software without encountering errors or freezing.

### Add a registry setting to Windows
Since the Zune software was created and optimized for Windows 7, there seems to be an issue with Windows automatically adding the necessary registry settings. In this step, we will add a setting to the registry in Windows.
1. Go to **[Zune Update - TOOLS](https://www.zuneupdate.com/resources/tools/)**.
2. Click **ZUNE-APP-SETTINGS-REG-FILE.ZIP**, and specify a folder to save the file to.
3. Go to the folder where you downloaded the ZIP file to.
4. Right-click **ZUNE-APP-SETTINGS-REG-FILE.ZIP**, and select **Extract All**. In the wizard, click **Extract**. A registry file will be extracted.

   > **Attention!:** If you're worried about the contents of the file and are comfortable checking what will be add to the Windows registry in the next step, you can open the file in Notepad++ to check its contents.

5. In the extracted folder, double-click **Zune Configure App Settings.reg**. If prompted, click **Run** to allow the file to be added to your registry.
6. When the warning appears, click **Yes**.
7. When the confirmation window appears, click **OK**.

### Update the "hosts" file in Windows
Since Microsoft decommissioned the server that facilitates communication between the Zune and the Zune software, we need to force the software to recognize the device. We do this by tricking the software into thinking the server is still available.
1. Open **File Explorer**.
2. Enter **%SystemRoot%\System32\drivers\etc** in the address bar, then click **Enter**.
3. Right-click **hosts**, click **Open with**, then select **Notepad++**.
4. At the bottom of the file, add the following to a new line: 

     66.115.173.227	resources.zune.net

4. Save the file.

   > **Note:** When saving the file, you may be prompted to launch Notepad++ in administrator mode since the "hosts" file is protected. If so, do the following:
   >	1. Click **Yes** to open the file in administrator mode.
   >	2. Click **Yes** when asked "Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device?".
   >	3. Save the file.

5. If you have a PIN code set up on your Zune device, enter the code to unlock the device.
6. Plug in your Zune device to your computer to automatically install the device driver.
7. Open the Zune software.

   > **Notes:** 
   > - If you previously reset your Zune to its factory default settings, you will see a different screen that shows your Zune has a "Required Update". If this screen appears, click **Accept**. Once this process is finished, you can begin syncing your media to your Zune HD.
   > - If the music you have synced on your Zune device is stored on a cloud service (for example, OneDrive or Google Drive), you may see a window with the message "You haven't made a selection. Is this screen displayed correctly?" You can either wait until your music finishes downloading or you can cancel the files from being downloaded. After that, the Zune software will start from the initial setup screen.

8. If you want to apply the default settings to the Zune software, click **Start**. Or, if you want to change the default settings, click **Settings**, then, follow the screens in the setup wizard.

You can choose the folders you want to sync with your Zune device later by going to **Settings** in the Zune software. In **Collection**, you will see **Windows Libraries** where you can choose which folders to sync.

## How to add apps and games to your Zune
I've only tested adding these apps and games onto a Zune HD. I don't know if these instructions will work to install the apps and games on non-Zune HD devices.
1. Go to **[Zune HD Apps.zip](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rqsifa8ukbkvybb/Zune%20HD%20Apps.zip?dl=0)** on Dropbox.[^2]
2. Click **Download**, and specify a folder to save the file to.
3. Go to the folder where you downloaded the ZIP file to. 
4. Right-click **Zune HD Apps.zip** and click **Extract All**.
5. Follow the **Extract Compressed (Zipped) Folders** wizard to extract the files.
6. Go to **%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Zune**. 
7. At the top of the **File Explorer** window, click **New** and select **Folder**. Then, name the new folder **Applications**.
8. In the folder that you extracted the apps and games to, select which ones you want to add to your Zune. Then, move them into the **Applications** folder.
9. Connect your Zune device and open the Zune software. All the apps and games will automatically sync to your Zune.

   > **Note:** Many of the apps, especially ones that require connecting to an external service like Facebook and Twitter, no longer work because those services' APIs have been changed. Most of the games should be playable though.
